# Battle Layout Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Position Swap** ✓

- **Allies (Heroes)** are now positioned in the **front** at X=400
- **Enemies** are now positioned in the **back** at X=800
- This matches the desired layout shown in image 2

### 2. **Sprite Orientation** ✓

- **Allies** now face **forward** (facing_back = false)
- **Enemies** now face **backward** (facing_back = true)
- Removed horizontal flipping for enemies

### 3. **Z-Index Layering** ✓

- **Allies** have z-index = 10 (front layer)
- **Enemies** have z-index = 1 (back layer)
- **Ally shadows** have z-index = 9 (just below allies)
- **Enemy shadows** have z-index = 0 (just below enemies)

### 4. **Sprite Support** ✓

- Enhanced CHARACTER_ART mapping with all available character sprites:
  - hero, hero_warrior, rogue, healer, mage, mage_red
  - cleric_blue, knight_armored, archer_green, wizard_elder
  - barbarian, werewolf
- All character sprites from the art/battlers folder are now properly mapped

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/scenes/BattleScene.gd` - Updated positions, z-indices, and sprite mappings
2. `/workspace/scenes/BattleScene.tscn` - Updated initial sprite and shadow positions

## Visual Result

- The battle scene now matches the desired layout from image 2:
  - Enemies appear in the background (further away)
  - Allies appear in the foreground (closer to camera)
  - Proper layering ensures allies are always rendered on top of enemies

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple allies and enemies in battle (currently only 1v1 is supported)
- Dynamic positioning for party battles
- Formation system for team battles
